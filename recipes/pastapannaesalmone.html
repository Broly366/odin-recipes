            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The recipe for farfalle with fresh salmon is the ultimate dinner saver. We have experimented with the combination of farfalle and salmon in summer pastas such as farfalle with salmon, arugula and cherry tomatoes and the cold one with salmon, or in the spring version farfalle al salmone con taccole.</p>
                <p>In this case we have made a classic, suitable for any season: fresh salmon and cream come together to create a creamy and irresistible sauce.</p>
                <p>This is a quick and easy first course a bit like spaghetti aglio olio e peperoncino, pasta with tuna and even a similar version with ham!</p>
                <p>It is a first course that can be prepared in a matter of minutes and with a couple of tricks you will get a perfect dish!</p>
