        <h3>Description</h3>
            
            <p>The text you sent is about the history and evolution of Hawaiian poke. It originated as a simple dish of raw fish seasoned with seaweed, sea salt, and sometimes kukui nuts, and the word "poke" means "to slice" in Hawaiian.</p>
            <p>Immigrants from China and Japan brought new ingredients like sesame oil and soy sauce, which led to the evolution of the dish into what we know as poke today.</p>
            <p>The popularity of poke, especially ahi shoyu poke, soared in the 1970s. Poke bowls became a popular way to serve the seasoned raw fish over a bed of rice, and they are now enjoyed with various toppings, including avocado, veggies, seaweed, furikake, and sesame seeds.</p>
            <p>The versatility of poke bowls allows for experimentation and customization to suit individual tastes.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the seasoned rice</strong>: Using a fine mesh sieve/strainer, rinse the rice. ** Pour the water, vinegar, sesame oil and salt into a small saucepan (with a fitted lid) set over medium-high heat.
                     Stir to combine. Bring the liquid to a boil. 
                     Add the rinsed rice, stir to combine evenly with the liquid and return to a boil before securing it with a tight fitting lid and reducing the heat to low. Simmer the rice for 18 minutes. 
                     Remove the lid, fluff up the rice to make sure all the liquid is absorbed. Turn off the heat and let it sit on the hot stove for 2-3 minutes longer after fluffing it again. Alternatively, add all ingredients to a rice cooker and cook.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Make the Poke</strong>: Meanwhile in a large bowl, mix together the soy sauce, green onions, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, rice vinegar and ginger juice from jar of pickled ginger. Add the tuna and salmon, toss to coat. Set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the cucumber salad</strong>: In a small bowl, toss everything together.</li>
                <li>When the rice is done cooking, fluff it up and let it cool for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the wasabi citrus sauce</strong> by mixing everything together in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>To assemble, divide the rice between 4 bowls, top with the salmon and tuna poke, cucumber salad and any of the desired toppings. 
                    Drizzle the bowls with the wasabi citrus sauce.
                    **Don’t skip this quick, easy step—rinsing the rice before you cook it washes away some of the starch that’s on the surface of the rice, which is a good thing in this case.
                    It’ll help ensure that your rice is nice and fluffy, instead of mushy or gummy.
